## AWS_Spark_ML

### Environment
Setup an AWS EMR cluster with Spark 2.4.0

### Experiment
In this Experiment, I write a machine learning program under the Spark framework, by using the Python language with pyspark library that can classify samples from the MNIST dataset using library pyspark, where the MNIST dataset is a handwriting digital dataset. It contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. Each sample is a 28*28 black- white image of a digital. Such as these:
